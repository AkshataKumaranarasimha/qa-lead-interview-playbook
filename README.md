# QA Lead Interview Playbook  
**End-to-end QA leadership: strategy, automation frameworks, and quality metrics**

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository
This repository is a **living QA Lead playbook** that captures how I approach **quality engineering end to end** — from testing fundamentals and test planning to automation architecture, metrics, leadership, and release management.

It is intentionally designed to serve **two purposes**:

1. **Interview preparation**  
   A structured, revision-friendly guide covering the most important concepts, decisions, and scenarios expected in QA Lead / Senior SDET interviews.

2. **Practical reference**  
   A growing knowledge base with real-world examples, automation architecture patterns, metrics, and decision frameworks that can be applied in day-to-day QA leadership roles.

This repo evolves as I learn, practice, and refine my understanding of modern quality engineering.
